Hello~</br>
I am deciding to earnestly study step by step within the SystemProgramming folder of this Windows Repository, where diverse and essential examples have been provided.
Despite the uncertainty of whether this endeavor will prove beneficial in the future, I am determined to dilligently learn, one step at a time.
Good Luck.
